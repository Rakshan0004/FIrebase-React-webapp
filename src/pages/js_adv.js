// js is created in 1993 by brenden eich

// ecmascript

// let => keyword  undefined is default value for this 

// any value thats not a premitive it will inherit the object class

// const is used for variables which cannot be reassigned 


// let a = 'global'

// function fun() {
//     let a = 'function';
//     if(ture){
//         let a = 'block';
//         var b = 'hoisted'; var is not a block scope it will get hoisted 
//     }
// }

// object is a collection of key value pairs , it can inherit properties form each other thanks to the mechanism called the prototype chain
// human.__proto__.__proto__;

// every object has a private property that links to exactly one prototype 

// js supports OOPS, it has all data structured

// it is garbage collection:  it automatically deallocate objects form the memory when there are not refereced in the code 

// there is weakmap and weak set that contain properties taht can be garbage collected to reduce memory usage unlike map



// setTimeout(() => {
//     console.log('3 sectonds in the future');
//     setTimeout(() => {
//         console.log('10 seconds in the future');
//     }, 5000);
// }, 5000);

// promise is a object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
